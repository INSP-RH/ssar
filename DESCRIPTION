Description: ssar is an implementation of Gillespie's Stochastic Simulation
    Algorithm in R . It combines R's graphic and statistical capabilities with C
    ++ speed by using Rcpp. This package represents a severe speed improvement
    over previous packages available at CRAN. In addition, the package allows for
    simulation of Inhomogeneous Markov Chains. More information on the package can
    be found on the github repository.
